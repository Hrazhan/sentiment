# Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we provide a gold standard benchmark dataset of central Kurdish tweets that have been annotated by humans, along with another silver standard dataset that is automatically annotated. The gold standard dataset contains 1189 samples with positive, negative, neutral, mixed, and a none class which indicates that the tweet is objective with no sentiments. The silver standard dataset contains 1500 samples for three classes of positive, negative, and neutral.


We experimented with several machine learning models to classify the tweets into their respective sentiment categories. We have used Logistirc Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, and BiLSTM models. We have trained these models in two different settings, one with emojis and the other without emojis.
